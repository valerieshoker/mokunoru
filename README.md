hi! this is my first real coding project: a chrome extension called Moku Noru.
the title is a wordplay on one of my favorite things (bonus points if you can guess it!!)  

this project is a calming productivity tool built for brains that get overwhelmed easily — designed especially with my own ADHD in mind. everything here is meant to be visually soft, minimal, and functional without friction.

### key features:
- **pomodoro timer** (25/50 min work sessions + 5/10 min breaks)  
- **break mode** for short reset rituals  
- **to-do list** split into “today” and “later”  
- **archive** undeletes are stores for 7 days
- **custom styling** vintage cream + black palette, classic typography
- **little pet** tiny pet to cheer you on
- **gentle animations and toasts**
- **toggle views for tools/settings/archive**

thanks for stopping by! i hope this feels like a breath of fresh air for your mind <3
